                SQL Coding Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Ashanti, an analytics engineer intern at Apple on a mission to enhance my skills in SQL. Here, you’ll find a collection of SQL projects that I’ve been working on to advance my skills in data analysis and database management.

With my interests being focused on SQL and data visualization tools like Tableau, I am continually expanding my expertise to become a proficient data analyst.
